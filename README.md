Import the net_banking.sql database into your MySQL setup.

Edit the file connect.php and give proper username and password of your MySQL setup.

Open a browser and test wether the setup works or not by visiting the home page. Type "localhost/home.php" as the URL in the browser to visit the home page.

All the passwords and the usernames of both the admin and the customer can be found in the database i.e. in the file net_banking.sql.

Username of admin is "admin" & password is "password123".
